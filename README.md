## 2. Short description of this project :

A cricket player in an auction refers to an individual up for selection in a professional cricket league, where teams bid on players based on their skills, experience, and recent performances. This competitive bidding process, commonly seen in leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL), involves franchise teams vying to secure the best talents within their budget. Factors like batting or bowling ability, fitness, recent form, and international experience often influence a player's auction value, with top players often commanding high prices.
